# OlympiaKosivNx by Destors

<h2>Within this application I used the following techniques:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Used the best practices for creating Angular architecture from NRWL NX
    Monorepo.
  </li>
  <li>Tried to follow the rules of SOLID, DRY.</li>
  <li>
    Used an interesting layout technique, with the creation of a 12column
    system based on Angular Material breakpoints.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used service for creating custom svg icons using Angular Material icons.
    This is the best way to add icons to a page without creating new
    dependencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a basic dark theme with simple service on Angular Material. Working
    with AngularFire Api Firebase services and creating a basic backend
    architecture.
  </li>
  <li>Work with ngOptimazedImage.</li>
  <li>
    Creation of custom pipes and directives. Using typescript interfaces and
    strong typing.
  </li>
</ul>
