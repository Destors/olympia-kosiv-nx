# OlympiaKosivNx by Destors

<h1>The project was created at the request of a friend, the owner of a local gym.</h1>

I tried to use the best practices for building architecture on NX.

<h2>Within this application I used the following techniques:</h2>

-Used the best practices for creating Angular architecture from NRWL NX Monorepo.
-Tried to follow the rules of SOLID, DRY.
-Used an interesting layout technique, with the creation of a 12-column system based on Angular Material breakpoints.
-Used service for creating custom svg icons using Angular Material icons. This is the best way to add icons to a page without creating new dependencies.
-Create a basic dark theme with simple service on Angular Material.
-Working with AngularFire Api Firebase services and creating a basic backend architecture.
-Work with ngOptimazedImage.
-Creation of custom pipes and directives.
-Using typescript interfaces and strong typing.
